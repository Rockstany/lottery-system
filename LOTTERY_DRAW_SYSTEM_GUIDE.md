## What is This System?

Think of this as a **digital spinning wheel** for your church lottery, just like the traditional lottery draws you see on TV or at events. But instead of a physical wheel, we use a computer screen that shows an animated wheel.

**What it does:**
- Shows all lottery ticket numbers on a spinning wheel
- Randomly picks winners for each prize (1st prize, 2nd prize, etc.)
- Everyone can watch on a big screen (projector/TV)
- Saves all results automatically
- Cannot be cheated or manipulated

**What it looks like:**
Imagine a big colorful wheel on the screen with all the lottery book numbers written on it. When you click a button, the wheel spins really fast, then slowly stops on one number - that's the winner!

---

## Why Do We Need This Special System?

### The Old Way (Problems):
❌ **Physical draws with paper chits:**
- Someone might accidentally pick the wrong paper
- Papers can get mixed up
- Hard to prove it was fair
- Takes a long time
- People might doubt the process

❌ **Simple computer program:**
- Church admin could potentially change results
- No proof that it was random
- People might not trust it

### The New Way (Solutions):
✅ **This Special System:**
- **Nobody can cheat** - not even the church admin!
- **Truly random** - computer uses special randomness (like shuffling cards perfectly)
- **Everyone can watch** - big screen shows everything live
- **Automatic record** - computer saves everything
- **Transparent** - people can verify it was fair

**Think of it like this:**
Imagine a locked safe that opens automatically at a specific time. Even the person who locked it cannot open it before that time. Our system works similarly - during the draw, even the admin is locked out!

---

## The People Involved

### 1. 👤 **Church Admin / Group Admin**
**Who:** The person managing the lottery system daily (could be parish secretary, committee member)

**What they can do:**
- Add lottery books
- Collect payments
- See reports
- Set up the draw date and time

**What they CANNOT do during the draw:**
- Cannot login to the system
- Cannot change anything
- Cannot see the admin pages
- **Completely locked out!**

**Why?** To ensure nobody can interfere with the draw results.

---

### 2. 🎯 **The Viewer (Most Important Person for the Draw)**
**Who:** A trusted elder, priest, or respected community member chosen for this one task

**What they do:**
- Login on the draw day at the scheduled time
- Operate the spinning wheel on a laptop
- Select which prize to draw (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
- Click the "Spin" button
- Announce winners as they appear

**Special Powers:**
- ✅ Only person who can use the system during draw
- ✅ Has a special temporary account
- ✅ Admin cannot access even with their password

**Requirements:**
- Can use a laptop/computer (basic level is enough)
- Can click buttons and read the screen
- Trusted by the community
- Present on draw day

**No technical knowledge needed!** If you can use a mobile phone, you can do this.

---

### 3. 👥 **The Community / Public**
**Who:** Church members, lottery participants, everyone

**What they see:**
- The spinning wheel on the big screen (projector)
- Winners being announced live
- Cannot control anything (just watching)

**Think of it like watching TV** - you see everything happening but cannot change the channel!

---

## How the Draw Works - Step by Step

### 📅 **BEFORE THE DRAW DAY** (Admin's Job)

#### Step 1: Admin Creates the Viewer Account
**When:** 2-3 days before the draw
**What happens:**
1. Admin goes to "Draw Setup" page
2. Clicks "Create Viewer Account"
3. Computer generates a random username and password
4. **Important:** This password is shown ONLY ONCE on screen
5. Admin must write it down on paper or print it
6. Give this paper to the trusted Viewer person

**Example:**
```
DRAW VIEWER CREDENTIALS (Keep Safe!)
Username: viewer_a7f3e9c2
Password: x8h2j9kL4mP7qR3s
Secret Code: AB12CD
```

**Why random?** So nobody (not even the admin) can guess or remember it easily.

---

#### Step 2: Admin Schedules the Draw
**When:** 1-2 days before the draw
**What happens:**
1. Admin goes to "Schedule Draw" page
2. Selects the date and time (example: December 26, 2025, 5:00 PM)
3. Sets how long the draw will take (example: 1 hour)
4. Clicks "Schedule"

**What this does:**
- Sets a timer in the computer
- When the time comes, admin will be automatically locked out
- Only the Viewer can login

**Think of it like setting an alarm** - when it rings, the system switches to "Draw Mode"

---

### 🎬 **ON THE DRAW DAY**

#### Step 3: Setting Up (30 minutes before)
**What you need:**
- Laptop (any basic laptop works)
- Internet connection
- Projector or large TV screen
- HDMI cable to connect laptop to projector

**Setup:**
1. Connect laptop to projector using HDMI cable
2. Turn on projector
3. Laptop screen should appear on big screen
4. Open web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge - any will work)
5. Go to the website: `https://zatana.in/draw-viewer-login.php`

**At this point:** Don't login yet! Wait for the scheduled time.

---

#### Step 4: The Lockdown Starts (Exactly at scheduled time)
**What happens automatically:**
- Computer clock reaches 5:00 PM (or whatever time was set)
- System activates "Draw Mode"
- Admin pages are automatically locked
- If admin tries to login, they see a message: "Draw in progress, please wait"

**Think of it like a traffic light turning red** - admin must stop, cannot proceed.

---

#### Step 5: Viewer Logs In
**Now it's your turn!**

1. **Open the login page** (should already be open from Step 3)
2. **Enter the credentials** from the paper:
   - Type the username
   - Type the password
   - Type the secret code
3. **Click "Login"**

**What you'll see:**
A screen asking you to change your password immediately.

**Why change password?**
- So that admin can never use this account again (even after the draw)
- Extra security - you create a new password that only you know
- Admin cannot access this account later

4. **Create a new password:**
   - Type any password you want (write it down!)
   - Type it again to confirm
   - Click "Change Password & Continue"

**Don't worry!** You won't need this password after today. It's just for this one draw session.

---

#### Step 6: The Draw Screen Appears
**What you'll see on the screen:**

```

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**The screen has:**
1. **Top:** Event name
2. **Middle:** A large colorful wheel with numbers
3. **Bottom:** A dropdown menu and a big button

---

#### Step 7: Drawing the First Prize
**Let's say you're drawing the 1st Prize (₹1,00,000)**

**Steps:**
1. **Click on the dropdown menu** (says "Select Prize")
2. **Choose "1st Prize - ₹1,00,000"** from the list
3. **The button changes** to say: "🎰 SPIN FOR 1ST PRIZE"
4. **Take a deep breath!** (Build some suspense for the audience 😊)
5. **Click the big button**

**What happens next:**
- Button changes to "SPINNING..."
- You cannot click it again (computer disables it)
- The wheel starts spinning on screen

---

#### Step 8: The Spinning Animation
**What everyone sees:**

1. **Fast spinning (3-4 seconds):**
   - Wheel spins really fast
   - Numbers blur together
   - Exciting sound (optional)

2. **Slowing down (3-4 seconds):**
   - Wheel starts spinning slower
   - You can start seeing the numbers
   - Tension builds!

3. **Almost stopping (2-3 seconds):**
   - Wheel moves very slowly
   - Passing one number at a time
   - Everyone is watching closely!

4. **Final stop:**
   - Wheel stops completely
   - One number is at the top (the arrow points to it)
   - **THAT'S THE WINNER!**

**Total time:** About 10-15 seconds of spinning

**Think of it like:** Spinning a bottle game, or the wheel on TV game shows like "Wheel of Fortune"

---

#### Step 9: Winner Announcement
**Immediately after the wheel stops:**

**A big colorful screen covers everything:**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                   ║
║              🎉 WINNER! 🎉                       ║
║                                                   ║
║           1st Prize - ₹1,00,000                  ║
║                                                   ║
║               BOOK #389                           ║
║                                                   ║
║            John Mathew                            ║
║         St. Thomas Ward                           ║

║    [Continue to Next Draw →]                     ║
║                                                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**What you do:**
1. **Read out loud:** "The winner of 1st Prize is Book Number 389, John Mathew!"
2. **Let people celebrate** for a few seconds
3. **Click "Continue to Next Draw"** button

**The winner announcement disappears** and you're back to the wheel screen.

---

#### Step 10: Drawing More Prizes
**Repeat Steps 7-9 for each prize:**

1. Select "2nd Prize" from dropdown
2. Click "Spin"
3. Watch the wheel
4. Announce winner
5. Click "Continue"

Then do 3rd prize, 4th prize, and so on...

**The dropdown menu is smart:**
- Once you draw a prize, it disappears from the list
- You cannot accidentally draw the same prize twice
- System guides you through all prizes in order

---

#### Step 11: All Prizes Drawn
**When you finish the last prize:**

**The screen shows:**
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                   ║
║      🎊 ALL PRIZES HAVE BEEN DRAWN! 🎊          ║
║                                                   ║
║        The draw is now complete.                  ║
║                                                   ║
║    [View All Winners] [End Session]              ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**What you do:**

2. **Click "End Session"** to finish

**What happens:**
- Your viewer account is locked (cannot login again)
- Admin access is restored

**You're done!** Great job! 🎉

---

### 📱 **AFTER THE DRAW** (What Happens Next)

- Results are permanently locked

#### Results are Saved Forever

- "How was the winner selected?"

**Transparency = Trust!**

---

## Security Features Explained Simply

### 🔒 Security Feature #1: The Lockdown

**What it is:**
During the draw, the admin is completely locked out of the system.

**How it works:**
- Computer has a timer (like an alarm clock)
- When draw time comes, timer activates
- Admin pages close automatically
- Admin cannot login even with correct password
- Only Viewer can access

**Real-world example:**
Imagine a bank vault with a time-lock. Even the bank manager cannot open it before the scheduled time. Same concept!

**Why this matters:**
Admin cannot:
- Change lottery numbers
- Remove someone's entry
- Add fake entries
- See results before announcement
- Influence the draw in any way

---

### 🎲 Security Feature #2: True Randomness

**What it is:**
The computer picks winners using special random number generation (not predictable).

**How it works:**
- Computer uses something called "cryptographic randomness"
- It's like shuffling cards perfectly with your eyes closed
- Uses multiple sources of randomness:
  - Computer's internal clock (down to millionths of a second)
  - Random data from the computer's processor
  - Random data from your mouse movements
  - All mixed together

**Real-world example:**
Imagine throwing 10 dice, shuffling cards, and flipping coins all at the same time. Then mixing all those results together. That's how random it is!

**Why this matters:**
- Nobody can predict the winner
- Nobody can rig the system
- Every eligible book has equal chance
- Mathematically fair

**Fun fact:** This is the same randomness used by banks for security and by casinos for online gambling!

---

### 🔐 Security Feature #3: Password Change During Draw

**What it is:**
Viewer must change their password immediately after login.

**Why:**
- The admin created the original password
- After you change it, admin doesn't know the new password
- Even if admin writes down the original, it won't work
- Ensures admin cannot login as Viewer during or after draw

**Real-world example:**
Like changing locks on a new house. Previous owner had keys, but after you change locks, their old keys don't work.

---

### 📝 Security Feature #4: Audit Trail

**What it is:**
Computer records every single action taken during the draw.

**What gets recorded:**
- When Viewer logged in
- What time each prize was drawn
- Which book won each prize
- When password was changed
- When session ended
- Even records mouse clicks!

**Real-world example:**
Like a CCTV camera recording everything. If anyone questions the draw later, we have complete video-like evidence.

**Why this matters:**
- Proof that draw was conducted properly
- Shows no tampering occurred
- Can be reviewed by anyone
- Builds trust

---

### 🚫 Security Feature #5: Immutable Results

**What it is:**
Once a winner is selected, it cannot be changed. Even by admin. Even in the database.

**How it works:**
- Computer adds a special lock to the result
- Like writing in permanent marker vs pencil
- Database refuses any attempts to edit
- Error message appears if anyone tries

**Real-world example:**
Like notarizing a legal document. Once stamped by notary, cannot be changed.

**Why this matters:**
- Winners are final
- Nobody can change them later
- No favoritism possible
- Results are trustworthy

---

### ⏰ Security Feature #6: Automatic Safety Release

**What it is:**
If something goes wrong (laptop crashes, power failure), the system automatically returns to normal after the scheduled time.

**How it works:**
- Draw is scheduled for 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM (1 hour)
- At 6:00 PM, even if draw is not finished, lockdown ends
- Admin can access again
- Safety mechanism to prevent system getting stuck

**Real-world example:**
Like a building's emergency exit that opens automatically during fire alarm.

**Why this matters:**
- System cannot be stuck forever
- Admin always regains access
- No need to call technical support
- Peace of mind

---

## What Can Go Wrong and How We Handle It

### ⚠️ Problem 1: "Laptop crashes during the draw"

**What happened:**
You're in the middle of drawing prizes, and suddenly the laptop freezes or shuts down.

**Don't panic! Here's what to do:**

**Step 1: Restart the laptop**
- Turn it off and on again
- Takes 2-3 minutes

**Step 2: Login again**
- Use your NEW password (the one you changed to)
- Not the original password from the paper

**Step 3: System remembers where you stopped**
- Already drawn prizes are saved
- Dropdown menu shows remaining prizes
- Just continue from where you stopped

**What if you forgot the new password?**
- Wait for scheduled time to end (1 hour usually)
- Admin access returns
- Admin can create new viewer account
- Start again (previously drawn prizes are already saved)

**Think of it like:** A video game with save points. If game crashes, you restart from last save point, not from beginning!

---

### ⚠️ Problem 2: "Internet connection lost"

**What happened:**
WiFi stops working or internet goes down.

**Good news:**
**The wheel animation works without internet!** Once the page loads, everything runs on your laptop (not on internet).

**What still needs internet:**
- Saving results to database
- Admin accessing the system

**What to do:**
1. **Continue with the draw normally**
   - Wheel will still spin
   - Winners will be shown
   - Everything works locally

2. **Write down winners on paper** (backup)
   - Prize name
   - Book number
   - Winner name

3. **When internet comes back:**
   - Results get saved automatically
   - Or admin can enter them manually from your paper

**Think of it like:** Using a calculator without internet. It still calculates, just doesn't sync to cloud.

---

### ⚠️ Problem 3: "I accidentally closed the browser"

**What happened:**
You clicked the X button by mistake or pressed Alt+F4.

**What to do:**
1. **Open browser again**
2. **Go to the same website**
3. **Login with your changed password**
4. **Continue drawing remaining prizes**

**Already drawn prizes are safe!** Computer saved them.

---

### ⚠️ Problem 4: "Power failure in the building"

**What happened:**
Complete blackout, everything shuts down.

**What to do:**

**Option A: If power comes back within scheduled time (1 hour)**
1. Restart laptop
2. Check if projector/internet is working
3. Login and continue

**Option B: If power takes too long**
1. Reschedule the draw
2. Admin (once lockdown time expires) can create new schedule
3. Announce new date/time to people
4. Already drawn prizes remain valid (optional: can redraw all if people prefer)

**Think of it like:** A cricket match stopped by rain. Either resume later or reschedule.

---

### ⚠️ Problem 5: "People doubt the draw was fair"

**What happened:**
Someone says "This seems fixed" or "How do we know it's random?"

**What you can show them:**

**1. The Audit Log:**
Admin can print a report showing:
- Exact time each prize was drawn
- Computer's random number calculations
- Every action taken during draw
- Technical proof of randomness

**2. The Eligible Books List:**
Before draw, system freezes the list of eligible books:
- Shows exactly which books were in the draw
- Proves no books added/removed during draw
- Anyone can verify their book was included

**3. The Math:**
Every eligible book had equal chance:
- If 450 books were eligible
- Each book had 1/450 chance for first prize
- Then 1/449 for second prize
- And so on...

**Think of it like:** Police body cameras. Everything is recorded, nothing hidden.

---

### ⚠️ Problem 6: "Viewer needs to leave urgently"

**What happened:**
Family emergency, health issue, cannot continue.

**What to do:**

**Option 1: Finish current prize**
- Complete the prize you're currently drawing
- Click "End Session"
- Partially complete draw (can resume later)

**Option 2: Emergency handover**
1. Call the admin
2. Tell them you need to stop
3. Admin waits for lockdown time to expire
4. Admin creates new viewer account
5. New trusted person continues the remaining prizes

**Tip:** If possible, have a backup viewer present (sitting in audience). Just in case!

### 👤 Questions from Viewers

**Q1: I'm not good with computers. Can I still do this?**

**A:** Absolutely yes! If you can:
- Use a smartphone
- Click buttons
- Read text on screen

Then you can operate this system. It's designed to be simple:

Many church elders have successfully operated similar systems!

---

**Q2: What if I click the wrong prize by mistake?**

**A:** Don't worry! System has safety features:
1. Before spinning, you can change your selection
2. After you click "Spin", a confirmation message appears: "Draw 1st Prize now?"
3. You must click "Yes" to proceed
4. Only after confirmation does wheel spin

**Think of it like:** Phone asking "Are you sure you want to delete?" before deleting anything.

---

**Q3: Can I practice before the actual draw day?**

**A:** Yes! Great idea!

**How:**
- Ask admin to create a "test event"
- Admin gives you test login credentials
- Practice with fake lottery numbers

**Recommendation:** Practice 1-2 days before actual draw.

---



### 👨‍💼 Questions from Admins

**Q7: What if viewer forgets to end the session?**

**A:** System handles this automatically:

**Scenario:**
- Draw scheduled: 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM (1 hour)
- Viewer finishes at 5:30 PM but forgets to click "End Session"
- Viewer just closes laptop and leaves

**What happens:**
- At 6:00 PM (scheduled end time), lockdown automatically expires
- You regain admin access at 6:00 PM
- All drawn prizes are already saved
- No problem!

**Additional safety:** Background job checks every 5 minutes and auto-releases any expired lockdowns.

---

**Q8: Can I run multiple draws on the same day?**

**A:** Not recommended for same event, but technically possible:

**Better approach:**
- One draw per day per event
- Multiple prizes in one draw session
- Complete all prizes before ending

**If you must do separate sessions:**
- Schedule them 2+ hours apart
- Different viewer accounts for each
- Clear communication to audience

---

**Q9: What if someone hacks the website during draw?**

**A:** Multiple security layers protect against this:

**Layer 1: Lockdown**
- Even if hacker gets admin password, they're locked out during draw
- Lockdown timer cannot be bypassed

**Layer 2: Viewer Authentication**
- Viewer account has random username
- Password is changed during draw
- Hacker doesn't know current password

**Layer 3: Database Protection**
- Special locks prevent editing results
- Even direct database access won't work
- All changes are logged

**Layer 4: Session Security**
- Unique session key for each draw
- Required to make any changes
- Only viewer's browser has this key

**Think of it like:** A bank vault with 4 different locks. Hacker needs all 4 keys at once - nearly impossible!

---

**Q10: How much does this system cost to run?**

**A:** Very affordable:

**Hosting:** ₹200-400 per month (Hostinger shared hosting)
**Domain:** ₹500-800 per year
**Maintenance:** Minimal (system runs automatically)

**Total:** About ₹3,000-5,000 per year

**One-time cost:**
- Development (already done if you're reading this!)
- Setup: ₹0-2,000

**Compared to traditional draws:**
- No printing draw tickets
- No physical wheel rental
- No manual verification costs
- Saves time = saves money

---

### 👥 Questions from Community Members

**Q11: How do I know my lottery book was included in the draw?**

**A:** After the draw, admin can provide:

**1. Eligible Books Report:**
- List of all book numbers included
- Shows payment status
- Proves your book was in the draw

**2. Your Book Status:**
- Login to your member account
- See your book status: "Included in draw" or "Not eligible (reason)"

**3. Public Verification Page:**
- Anyone can check
- Enter book number
- See if it was eligible
- See payment history

---

**Q12: Can I watch the draw online from home?**

**A:** Currently, this system is designed for physical attendance:
- Draw happens in church hall
- Everyone watches projected screen
- Community gathering/event

**Future possibility:**
- Live streaming could be added
- YouTube/Facebook live of the projected screen
- Not automatic, requires manual setup

**Why physical attendance is better:**
- Builds community
- Transparency (everyone sees same screen at same time)
- Celebration together
- Traditional church event atmosphere

---

**Q14: Can the same book win multiple prizes?**

**A:** Depends on church policy:

**Option A: One book = One prize (recommended)**
- If book wins 1st prize, removed from next draws
- More people win
- Fair distribution

**Option B: One book = Multiple prizes possible**
- Book stays in all draws
- Could win multiple prizes
- More exciting for players

**Admin configures this before draw.** Check with your church committee which policy they're using.
